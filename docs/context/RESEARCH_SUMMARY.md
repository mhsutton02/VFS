# Research Summary — Leadership Bio Page + Site Updates
**Date:** 2026-02-07

## 1. Leadership Bio Page Best Practices (Big Firms Pattern)

### Page Layout
- **Card grid on listing page**: Major firms use 3-column grids with headshot, name, title. Clicking opens detail.
- For a small team (3 people), a **single-page layout** works best: intro section at top, then individual bio sections stacked vertically with alternating left/right image placement.
- Each bio gets its own section: photo on one side, name + title + condensed bio on the other.

### Bio Content Structure (per person)
1. **Name** (large, prominent)
2. **Title/Role** (accent-colored kicker)
3. **2 paragraph bio** (~100-130 words total — condensed from current ~150-200)
4. Third-person voice, professional but approachable
5. Every sentence conveys a credential, achievement, or domain expertise
6. No fluff — cut marketing jargon, redundant adjectives

### Bio Professionalization Rules
- Use third-person narrative voice
- Concise, polished language — no templates or artificial phrasing
- Quantifiable achievements where possible
- Include notable employers, credentials, military service
- Crosslink to LinkedIn if available
- Organize with scannable structure (short paragraphs, not walls of text)

## 2. About Us Content (from about_us.txt)
Strong company description with concrete achievements:
- Digital twins, AI-driven networks, geospatial datasets
- 15-20% margin gains, 50x productivity improvements
- Military-rooted integrity + Big Four consulting rigor
- Should integrate into About section or combined Leadership page

## 3. Giving Back Section Updates (User Request)
- Replace generic text with focused statement about investing profits in causes + hiring vets/first responders
- Replace AI-generated image with row of real partner logos (linked)
- **Hire Heroes USA** is the correct org name
- Need to verify all org names from current content

## 4. Mobile Issues (User Report)
- Android download prompt (PWA/service worker issue)
- Carousel cards cluttered on mobile — convert to paragraphs under headings
